		<h2>Pink dress</h2>
		<h3>December 13th to 22nd 2021</h3>
		<h4>chiffon, ribbon, interfacing, elastic</h4>
		<p>I bought about
			two hundred vintage sewing patterns secondhand and failed to get my sister something for
			Christmas. So I made a selkie inspired dress in nine days. I’d say I learned to give myself more
			time but I did not. I really relish in the flex of working a full time job and finishing a dress using
			a material I had never worked with before in a quick turn around. I did learn that keeping
			multiple sewing machines is a positive quirk to have when you overwork your Singer Heavy
			Duty you can switch to a back up machine without missing a beat.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<h2>Imogen</h2>
		<h3>May 20th to 26th 2022</h3>
		<h4>charmeuse, interfacing, satin, embroidery floss, polymer clay,
			bed sheet, buttons</h4>
		<p>A commissioned cosplay of the character Imogen Temult from Critical Role
			campaign 3 (I haven’t started c3 yet, so no spoilers) I sourced the brown imitation leather harness
			as I got the green light to actually make the cosplay two weeks before the client's deadline
			and did not have time to make a harness from scratch with my current resources. I combined
			several blouse patterns for the dress and just did two panels for the skirt. I originally used purple
			plastic buttons but I elected to swap them with handmade polymer clay buttons to match better.
			The client also asked for shorts 48 hours before the deadline so I bleached and cut off a pair
			of jeans and altered them at the final fitting. The crunch time required for this ensemble was
			exciting and satisfying but I would give myself more time to find a different material because
			while the charmeuse is pretty it snags too much for an adventurer sleeping under the stars.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<h2>LSP dress</h2>
		<h3>February to May 2022</h3>
		<h4>bed sheets, fabric dye, interfacing, zipper, sheer curtains
			repurposed, press button snaps embroidery floss, safety pin, repurposed star from a hair clip,
			acrylic paint, paint marker</h4>
		<p>“I’m a blossoming debutante on a warpath.” Lumpy Space Princess
			is the epitome of confidence. I made this for a friend over several months. First I dyed a light
			purple bed sheet a bit darker which resulted in a blotchiness from my small boiling pot that looked really cool
			but was not what I was going for so I worked around it. Second I made the Squeez-E-Mart
			applique which you can read more about under embroidery. Then I constructed the base dress as
			a standalone garment adding a side zipper as the pattern didn’t have a closure and a pocket
			because to not add pockets is unforgivable. I made the slip dress out of sheer curtains I sourced
			second hand and hand stitched together with upholstery thread and a whip stitch for strength. I
			added press button snaps on the slip dress and under the front and back cuff along the neckline. I
			used a soldering iron and a butane torch to create the frayed skirt as preliminary tests confirmed
			cutting the strips would cause the garment to fall apart and hemming the frays loses the “trash”
			look. Finally, I took apart a hair clip that had a plastic star decoration, primed it white, colored
			over it with a yellow acrylic paint marker, and gorilla glued a safety pin to the back. This is a
			standalone purple dress that can be turned into a conceptual cosplay.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<h2>Tris dress</h2>
		<h3>April 2021</h3>
		<h4>rayon, tulle, interfacing, horsehair braid, boning, hook and eye closure</h4>
		<p>So I’ve been in the same dungeons & dragons campaign since 2018 with dearly ridiculous
			friends. This gown was made for a session in which one of my friends officiated a wedding
			between two characters played by one person. Afterwards another friend gave a speech for his
			imaginary daughter’s wedding toast entirely in Spanish. Everyone was in formal wear. I love
			them all so much. What I learned from this dress was: give yourself more time when combining
			patterns as the bodice may not work as intended and you have to drape a new one. I also learned
			that just because you can make a similar shape out of a heavy wire hanger does not mean that
			you will be happy with the results, hence the multiple bodices pictured.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<h2>Swifty dress</h2>
		<h3>May 2021</h3>
		<h4>satin, interfacing, ribbon, grommets</h4>
		<p>My sister turned 22 years old on
			June 11th of 2021 so, feeling 22, she requested a Taylor Swift inspired dress arrive before her
			birthday. I went with the 2016 Grammys red carpet look and learned that ironing your fabric is
			essential when working with easily creased materials. Also that having your subject for fittings is
			a make or break with form hugging garments.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<h2>Yellow overalls</h2>
		<h3>February 2021</h3>
		<h4>zipper, bed sheets, buttons ribbon, snap closure</h4>
		<p>I wanted a yellow overall dress, I made one. A lot of the time I have multiple projects going at once so it’s
			hard to say how long one piece took to finish. I used a two inch satin ribbon as seam binding
			where the skirt meets the bib because the gathers made for a lot of fabric. At this stage I was
			uncertain of my abilities so I would cut larger seam allowances. I think this is still useful
			especially when draping or making garments for other people that I will need to fit to them as the
			excess fabric is easy to cut away if needed.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<h2>Moth skirt</h2>
		<h3>October 2021</h3>
		<h4>polyester tapestries, bed sheet, interfacing, zipper</h4>
		<p>Interesting patterned fabric is expensive and I love to repurpose materials. This was a bit of a test for me so I
			purchased five of the cheapest tapestries I actually would wear from Amazon, pocketed the
			complimentary wall hooks to hang the tapestries, and steamed all five to learn I’d use about three
			and a half. I added the white inner lining because I was not confident the tapestry would hold up
			in a washing machine by itself. I’m happy to report that with the liner it has survived multiple
			spin cycles.</p> </div> <div  class="gallery">

		<p>I thrifted a gown to
